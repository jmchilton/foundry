# Galaxy Workflow Foundry

![Galaxy Workflow Foundry](site/public/images/foundry-logo-classic.svg)

Knowledge base + casting pipeline for building Galaxy workflows with `gxwf`.

An LLM can read a paper or a Nextflow pipeline and propose a Galaxy workflow — and fail the same boring, detectable ways every time: hallucinated tool IDs, dropped `+galaxyN` revisions, fabricated parameter names, `gxformat2` the parser rejects on line one. Hand-authored "convert a workflow" skills paper over these with prose caveats that don't compose and rot on the next regression. The Foundry's bet: **a knowledge base becomes useful when its structure makes it executable, and a skill becomes trustworthy when its source stays inspectable.**

Site: <https://galaxyproject.github.io/foundry/>

## Goal

Convert workflows authored in other systems — papers describing computational analyses, Nextflow pipelines, CWL workflows — into validated Galaxy workflows in the `gxformat2` format. The Foundry decomposes that conversion into atomic, schema-validated steps that an LLM agent can execute reliably, grounded in `gxwf`'s static validation of `gxformat2` and tool steps.

## Why

Hand-authored, monolithic conversion skills are brittle, hard to test, and don't compose. The Foundry takes a different shape:

- **Principled.** The Foundry keeps upstream systems authoritative, records provenance for derived artifacts, uses deterministic tooling for deterministic checks, and keeps source knowledge portable across agent runtimes. See `content/meta/guiding-principles.md`.
- **Decomposed.** Each conversion step is its own Mold — a typed reference manifest that casts into a self-contained skill artifact. The full conversion is an ordered Pipeline of Molds.
- **Schema-driven.** `gxwf` validates every authored step inline. The validation loop catches failure modes deterministically — UUID validity, tool-ID and `+galaxyN` revision suffixes, `input_connections` parameter-name mismatches, conditional-selector branches in `tool_state` — rather than relying on enumerated prose caveats.
- **Corpus-grounded.** Patterns and Molds are derived from observed structure in the IWC workflow corpus, not invented top-down. Every reference is traceable back to one or more curated, working `gxformat2` exemplars; the same exemplars double as evaluation material for cast skills.
- **Agent-friendly.** Cast skills are condensed, isolated, and frozen against the Foundry version they were cast from. No runtime dependency on the Foundry, no chasing wiki-links from inside a skill. Casting is the integration boundary.

## What's here

- **Pipelines** (`content/pipelines/`) — ordered Mold sequences composing into an end-to-end conversion (`paper-to-galaxy`, `nextflow-to-galaxy`, `cwl-to-galaxy`, `interview-to-galaxy`, `update-interview-to-galaxy`, `paper-to-cwl`, `nextflow-to-cwl`). Build artifact and primary navigation surface.
- **Molds** (`content/molds/`) — abstract templates describing a workflow-construction action. Each Mold is a typed reference manifest: it declares the patterns, CLI manual pages, schemas, prompts, and examples it depends on, and casts into one or more skill artifacts.
- **Patterns** (`content/patterns/`) — Galaxy workflow construction reference (collection manipulation, tabular manipulation, conditional handling, custom-tool authoring). Wiki-linked from action Molds; pulled into cast skills via casting's pattern-kind dispatch.
- **CLI manual pages** (`content/cli/<tool>/`) — one note per command or subcommand, covering `gxwf`, `planemo`, `cwltool`, `cwl-utils`, `foundry`, and `galaxy-tool-cache`. Cast to JSON sidecars by action Molds that reference exact commands.
- **Schemas** (`content/schemas/`) — `<name>.md` schema notes only; the JSON Schema itself lives in its TypeScript package at `packages/<name>-schema/src/<name>.schema.json` (Foundry-authored) or is synced there from an upstream npm package (vendored). The note's frontmatter declares `package` + `package_export`. `site/src/lib/schema-registry.ts` imports each schema directly from the package; Mold frontmatter cites schemas via `[[wiki-link]]` and cast imports the named runtime export at build time, serializing it verbatim into cast bundles.
- **Casts** (`casts/claude/skills/<name>/`) — generated Agent Skills shared by Claude Code and Codex. The historical target path remains while thin runtime manifests package the same tree for both products.

## Install generated skills

The committed `casts/claude/` plugin root is dual-runtime: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` both expose the same `skills/` directory.

Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add galaxyproject/foundry
/plugin install foundry-skills@galaxy-workflow-foundry
/foundry-skills:discover-shed-tool
```

Codex CLI:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add galaxyproject/foundry
codex plugin add foundry-skills@galaxy-workflow-foundry
```

Then run `/skills` or type `$` to select a skill such as `$discover-shed-tool`. Codex can also select a skill implicitly from its description. Restart Codex after installing or refreshing the plugin if the skills do not appear.

## Authoring

Two flows feed the Foundry:

- **Claude slash commands** (`.claude/commands/`) — current contributor workflows for agent-driven scaffold-prompt-validate.
- **Hand edits** + `npm run validate` — small fixes.

Casting produces skill artifacts: `npm run cast -- <slug> --target=claude`.

Frontmatter is contract-enforced by the shared zod schema in `@galaxy-foundry/gxwf-foundry-note-schema` (used by both the validator and the site); every note carries a registered tag from `meta_tags.yml`. Validate before commit.

## Tooling

```sh
npm run validate          # schema + cross-file checks
npm run test              # vitest suite
npm run typecheck         # tsc --noEmit
npm run dashboard         # generate content/Dashboard.md
npm run index             # generate content/Index.md
npm run readme            # refresh this file's corpus counts
npm run cast              # cast a Mold (see above)
npm run test-skill -- <skill> --prompt <task> --provider <provider> --model <model>
npm run pi-test-auth -- login  # isolated OpenAI/Codex OAuth for local test runs
npm run site:dev          # Astro dev server
```

`--check` variants on the generators detect drift; CI runs them before deploy.

## Package releases

Public workspace packages are versioned with Changesets and published from
GitHub Actions using npm OIDC trusted publishing and provenance. See
[`docs/development/publication.md`](docs/development/publication.md) for the
release flow and the one-time bootstrap required for a new npm package.

## Design docs

Long-form design narrative under [`content/meta/`](content/meta/), as notes of kind `meta` —
so the collection, not this list, is the authority on which records exist. Read in `order`:

**Foundation**

1. [`guiding-principles.md`](content/meta/guiding-principles.md) — why the Foundry prioritizes upstream authority, provenance, deterministic tooling, portability, actionable knowledge, and corpus grounding.
2. [`architecture.md`](content/meta/architecture.md) — directory layout, types, validation pipeline, site rendering.
3. [`molds.md`](content/meta/molds.md) — the axes a Mold buckets on and the boundary against reference content.
4. [`mold-spec.md`](content/meta/mold-spec.md) — the Mold authoring contract: source layout, which files may sit beside `index.md`, and who enforces it.
5. [`casting.md`](content/meta/casting.md) — how typed Mold references become target-specific cast artifacts with provenance.
6. [`cast-walkthrough.md`](content/meta/cast-walkthrough.md) — one real committed cast annotated end to end.
7. [`eval-philosophy.md`](content/meta/eval-philosophy.md) — why `eval.md` is an abstract oracle and `scenarios.md` holds the concrete cases.
8. [`corpus.md`](content/meta/corpus.md) — IWC grounding; URL-not-mirror principle.
9. [`harness-pipelines.md`](content/meta/harness-pipelines.md) — pipeline narrative behind `content/pipelines/`.

**Infrastructure**

1. [`comparisons.md`](content/meta/comparisons.md) — positioning vs wikis/skill bundles plus a dated KB-to-skill landscape snapshot.
2. [`pattern-authorship.md`](content/meta/pattern-authorship.md) — authorship rules for operation-named, corpus-grounded pattern pages.
3. [`schema-packages.md`](content/meta/schema-packages.md) — where a Mold IO schema lives and how cast resolves one through a schema note.

[`content/meta/glossary.md`](content/meta/glossary.md) shares the directory and is deliberately not a note.

## Status

Working system. Every pipeline casts end-to-end into Claude skills, on top of `foundry-build cast` + `assemble-pipeline` and the live Astro site.

Forward work is quality and reach rather than existence. Review is underway rather than finished, and eval coverage is partial — `eval.md` and `scenarios.md` are `recommended` rather than `required`, and the table below is what that costs today. Claude is the only cast target; a second one begins with a `casts/<target>/_target.yml`, which is what makes a target real.
