summary: "Vendored formal spec of Galaxy dataset-collection mapping/reduction semantics, with labeled examples and pinned test references."
---

> **Vendored from upstream**, pinned at SHA `7765fae`. Two files live next to this note:
>
> - `galaxy-collection-semantics.yml` — the structured source. **Agents and casting should consume this.** It carries the `tests:` blocks that pin concrete Galaxy test names; the rendered upstream view drops them.
> - `galaxy-collection-semantics.upstream.myst` — Galaxy's auto-generated MyST/LaTeX rendering of the YAML, vendored only so the human view below has something to render. Sync is manual.
>
> **When to consult:** authoring or reasoning about Molds and patterns that touch `data_collection` inputs, map-over / reduction shape changes, sub-collection mapping, `paired_or_unpaired`, or `sample_sheet`.
