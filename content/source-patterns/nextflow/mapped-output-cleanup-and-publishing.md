# Nextflow: mapped output cleanup and publishing

Use this when a Nextflow source has mapped process outputs, cleanup/filtering around sparse results, final output aggregation, or `publishDir`/output-layout intent.

## Source signal

- Repeated `tuple(meta, path(...))` outputs from mapped processes.
- Operators like `map`, `filter`, `branch`, `collect`, `toList`, `collectFile`, and `mix` near outputs.
- `publishDir` directives, output `emit:` names, report channels, or version channels.
- Naming cleanup via metadata, regex, filenames, or task-derived labels.

## Galaxy translation

1. Treat mapped process output as a Galaxy collection map-over result.
2. Drop unusable per-element outputs with empty/failed collection filters.
3. If cleanup changes membership, sync sibling collections from cleaned identifiers.
4. Relabel outputs when Nextflow metadata or filenames carried element identity.
5. Aggregate report-ready collections into tables, wide matrices, bundles, or singleton outputs.
6. Gate report/export steps when the whole result may be empty.
7. Translate `publishDir` intent to Galaxy output labels, collections, bundles, or reports; do not preserve filesystem layout literally.

## Pattern handoffs

- Cleanup: `[[collection-cleanup-after-mapover-failure]]`.
- Cleanup + sibling sync + publishing: `[[cleanup-sync-and-publish-nonempty-results]]`.
- Sibling membership sync: `[[sync-collections-by-identifier]]`.
- Label cleanup: `[[regex-relabel-via-tabular]]`, `[[relabel-via-rules-and-find-replace]]`.
- Non-empty report gate: `[[conditional-gate-on-nonempty-result]]`.
- Publishing bundles/reports: `[[collection-build-named-bundle]]`, `[[tabular-concatenate-collection-to-table]]`, `[[tabular-pivot-collection-to-wide]]`, `[[collection-unbox-singleton]]`.

## Pitfalls

- Cleanup is not publishing.
- Dropping bad elements changes collection membership.
- Identifier sync is not order sync.
- `publishDir` paths are source-side filesystem presentation, not Galaxy workflow structure.
- Do not translate arbitrary Groovy output-name logic from syntax alone.

## Evidence posture

This page is grounded in existing Foundry lifecycle and source-shape notes. `publishDir` specifics remain under-supported without direct fixture evidence.
