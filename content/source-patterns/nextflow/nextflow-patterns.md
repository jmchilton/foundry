# Nextflow: source pattern map

This is the source-facing map for Nextflow-to-Galaxy conversion patterns. Use it when the source evidence is a Nextflow channel shape or operator idiom rather than a Galaxy operation.

The Galaxy pattern library remains the implementation layer. Source-pattern pages should explain what the converter saw in Nextflow, then link to the Galaxy patterns that implement or approximate that source idiom.

## Intended operation or recipe pages

- [[samplesheet-rows-to-galaxy-collections]] — route `fromSamplesheet`, `splitCsv`, and repeated `tuple(meta, path)` inputs toward Galaxy `list`, `paired`, and `list:paired` collection construction.
- [[keyed-join-to-identifier-synchronized-mapover]] — route `join` and `combine(by:)` toward identifier extraction, filtering, sorting, and relabeling patterns.
- [[grouped-channel-to-regrouped-collection]] — route `groupTuple`, `transpose`, and grouped tuple payloads toward nested collections, Apply Rules reshaping, flattening, or domain reduction.
- [[branch-filter-ifempty-to-galaxy-filters-gates]] — route `branch`, `.filter`, and `.ifEmpty` toward Galaxy filters, conditional gates, or review triggers.
- [[mix-collect-to-report-aggregation]] — route `mix`, `collect`, `toList`, and `collectFile` toward report aggregation, tabular collapse/pivot, and output bundles.
- [[mapped-output-cleanup-and-publishing]] — route mapped output cleanup and `publishDir` intent toward filtering, relabeling, gating, bundles, and report outputs.

## Metadata contract

Each source-pattern page should list the Galaxy implementation pages in `implemented_by_patterns`. That field is machine-validated to resolve only to `type: pattern` notes.

Use `review_triggers` when the Nextflow idiom has semantics Galaxy cannot preserve automatically: unmatched join keys, duplicate keys, `remainder`, arbitrary tuple records, per-element dynamic branching, or filesystem-specific `publishDir` layout.
