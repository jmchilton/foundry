- [[nfcore-meta-map-to-galaxy-params]] — Promote nf-core meta-map keys to Galaxy <param>s only when they drive script behavior; drop identity-only keys; pull naming from $input.element_identifier.
- [[nfcore-stub-block-to-galaxy-noop-test]] — nf-core's stub: block has no Galaxy analog; the convert Mold drops it intentionally and records the drop in _provenance.yml.
- [[nfcore-task-ext-args-to-galaxy-additional-options]] — Map nf-core's task.ext.args escape hatch to a single Galaxy text param surfacing extra command-line arguments.
- [[nfcore-versions-emit-to-galaxy-version-command]] — Translate nf-core's versions emit (heredoc or topic: versions) into Galaxy's <version_command>, dropping the versions output channel.
- [[nf-schema-samplesheet-galaxy-gaps]] — nf-schema validation mapped to Galaxy column_definitions: what survives, degrades, or is lost; Galaxy work items + cast loss-recording vocabulary.
- [[open-requirements-ledger]] — Carried unresolved-requirements artifact the source→Galaxy pipeline discharges or explicitly surrenders, autonomously.
- [[planemo-asserts-idioms]] — Decision and idiom guide for picking planemo workflow-test assertions: which family per output type, how to size tolerances, when to validate.
- [[planemo-workflow-test-architecture]] — Reference for Planemo workflow test/run architecture, Galaxy modes, API polling, and noisy failure boundaries.

## Cli Tool

- [[cwl-utils]] — CWL document utilities. summarize-cwl uses cwl-normalizer to gather references and upgrade to v1.2 JSON.
- [[cwltool]] — Reference CWL runner and validator. Used by summarize-cwl for entrypoint validation.
- [[foundry]] — Foundry CLI: bundles all Mold IO validators and a summarize-nextflow subcommand.
- [[galaxy-tool-cache]] — Cache and inspect Galaxy tool metadata (fetch from ToolShed, summarize ParsedTool, export input JSON Schema).
- [[gxwf]] — Galaxy workflow design-time CLI (validate, convert, lint, roundtrip, tool-cache discovery).
- [[planemo]] — Galaxy tool/workflow runtime testing CLI; used by run-workflow-test and friends.

## Meta

- [[architecture]] — A short map of the Foundry's major parts, boundaries, and focused architecture records. *(reviewed)*
- [[build-and-validation]] — How authored Foundry source is checked, generated, cast, assembled, rendered, and kept current. *(reviewed)*
- [[cast-walkthrough]] — One real committed cast (discover-shed-tool) annotated end to end: every bundle file traced back through per-kind dispatch and _provenance.json. *(reviewed)*
- [[code-architecture]] — Implementation components, dependency direction, entry points, and contracts across the Foundry codebase. *(reviewed)*
- [[comparisons]] — Where the Foundry sits versus wikis, skill bundles, and the KB-to-skill landscape (MCP, Agent Skills, llms.txt, Corpus2Skill, RAG) — a dated snapshot. *(reviewed)*
- [[casting]] — How typed Mold references become target-specific cast artifacts with provenance. *(reviewed)*
- [[content-model]] — How Foundry notes, kinds, metadata, tags, links, references, and companions represent knowledge. *(reviewed)*
- [[corpus]] — How IWC grounding works without turning the Foundry into an upstream workflow mirror. *(reviewed)*
- [[eval-philosophy]] — Why eval.md is an abstract oracle and scenarios.md holds the concrete cases, and the eval/scenario/refinement split. *(reviewed)*
- [[guiding-principles]] — The design pressure behind source authority, progressive disclosure, validation, portability, and corpus grounding. *(reviewed)*
- [[harness-pipelines]] — The source-to-target journeys that compose Molds, loops, and branch phases. *(reviewed)*
- [[mold-spec]] — The Mold authoring contract: source layout, which files may sit beside index.md, and who enforces it. *(reviewed)*
- [[molds]] — The axes a Mold buckets on, the boundary against reference content, and where the Mold set is still uneven. *(reviewed)*
- [[pattern-authorship]] — Developer-facing authorship rules for operation-named, corpus-grounded pattern pages. *(reviewed)*
- [[repository-layout]] — Where authored source, implementation code, generated artifacts, fixtures, and site files belong. *(reviewed)*
- [[schema-packages]] — Where a Mold IO schema lives, how cast resolves one through a schema note, and why there is no separate schema package. *(reviewed)*
