# `gxwf tool-search`

Free-text search over the Galaxy Tool Shed's tool index. Designed to feed `galaxy-tool-cache add` (and the rest of the `tool-versions` / `tool-revisions` chain) so a workflow author can go from a query string to a cached `ParsedTool` in a small number of commands.

Instance-agnostic; targets `https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu` by default.

## Install

Use the Foundry-supported `gxwf` CLI from `@galaxy-tool-util/cli` or the Python package with the matching interface. Prefer the project-local executable when running inside a checked-out Foundry or galaxy-tool-util workspace.

## Synopsis

```
gxwf tool-search <query> [options]
```

`<query>` is free text; whitespace separates terms. The Tool Shed wraps the term as `*term*` server-side, so noisy queries can match description and help text.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--page-size <n>` | Server-side page size (default `20`). |
| `--max-results <n>` | Hard cap on hits returned (default `50`). |
| `--page <n>` | Starting page (1-indexed; default `1`). |
| `--owner <user>` | Restrict to one repo owner. **Client-side filter** — `tool-search` has no server `owner:` keyword. |
| `--match-name` | Drop hits where the query is not a token in the tool name. Tightens noisy queries. |
| `--json` | Emit `{ query, hits: [NormalizedToolHit, ...] }`. |
| `--enrich` | Resolve each hit's `ParsedTool` (one fetch per hit) and attach as `parsedTool` on each JSON hit. Off by default. Best for skills that pick top 1–3; wasteful for paged exploration. |
| `--cache-dir <dir>` | Tool cache used by `--enrich`. Defaults to `galaxy-tool-cache`'s location. |

## Output

Default: human-readable list.

`--json`:

```json
{
  "query": "fastqc",
  "hits": [
    {
      "toolId": "fastqc",
      "name": "FastQC",
      "description": "Read Quality reports",
      "owner": "devteam",
      "repoName": "fastqc",
      "trsToolId": "devteam~fastqc~fastqc",
      "score": 12.3
    }
  ]
}
```

A hit identifies `(owner, repoName, toolId)` plus a `trsToolId` (`owner~repo~toolId`). It does **not** include a changeset revision or specific tool version — those come from [[tool-versions]] and [[tool-revisions]].

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | At least one hit. |
| `2` | Empty result (no hits, including after `--match-name` / `--owner` filtering). |
| `3` | HTTP / fetch error. |

## Examples

```bash
gxwf tool-search fastqc
gxwf tool-search "quality control" --json --max-results 10
gxwf tool-search bwa --owner devteam --match-name --json
```

Pipe the top hit into the rest of the pin chain:

```bash
gxwf tool-search fastqc --json --max-results 5 \
  | jq -r '.hits[0].trsToolId' \
  | xargs gxwf tool-versions --latest --json
```

## Gotchas

- **No EDAM**, no stem analyzer, no panel context — the Tool Shed tool index is much poorer than Galaxy's installed-toolbox index. Queries match only `name`, `description`, `help`, and `repo_owner_username`. See [[component-tool-shed-search]] §2b.
- **Case-sensitivity asymmetry**. The tool search does not lowercase the query (unlike repo search). Mixed-case queries can miss; lowercase if uncertain.
- **Stale indexes**. Tool Shed Whoosh indexes are rebuilt by cron / admin action, never automatically on upload. A freshly published tool may not show up for some time. Deprecated repos can still appear until the next rebuild.
- **`*term*` wrapping** disables server-side stemming and structured query syntax. Prefer simple terms; combine `--match-name` and `--owner` to tighten.
- **No exact-id matching**. The shed indexes `id` as `TEXT`, not Whoosh `ID`, so it tokenizes — you cannot pin a hit to an exact GUID via search.
- **Same XML id across repos**. The same logical tool (e.g., `bwa`) can be wrapped and published in multiple independent repos. Hits collapse only by `(repoName, owner)`; expect duplicates that need human triage.
- **Repo-level discovery is a different command**. For "find me a *package* about X" with server-side `owner:` / `category:` keywords and popularity-boosted ranking, use `gxwf repo-search` instead.

## Pairs with

- [[tool-versions]] — list TRS-published versions for a hit's `trsToolId`.
- [[tool-revisions]] — resolve a `(trsToolId, version)` to changeset revisions for reproducible pinning.
- `galaxy-tool-cache add` — terminal step of the discover-and-pin chain.
