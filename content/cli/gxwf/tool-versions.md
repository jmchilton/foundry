# `gxwf tool-versions`

List the TRS-published versions of a Tool Shed tool, ordered oldest→newest (newest last). Used after `[[tool-search]]` has surfaced a candidate `trsToolId` and the caller needs to pick a version to cache.

## Synopsis

```
gxwf tool-versions <tool-id> [options]
```

`<tool-id>` accepts both forms:
- TRS form: `owner~repo~tool_id` (e.g. `devteam~fastqc~fastqc`).
- Pretty form: `owner/repo/tool_id` (e.g. `devteam/fastqc/fastqc`).

The `~` form is the Tool Shed's TRS encoding (slashes break FastAPI path-param decoding); the CLI accepts both and normalizes.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--latest` | Print only the newest version. |
| `--json` | Emit `{ trsToolId, versions: [...] }`. |

## Output

Default: one version string per line, oldest first.

`--json`:

```json
{
  "trsToolId": "devteam~fastqc~fastqc",
  "versions": ["0.72+galaxy1", "0.73+galaxy0", "0.74+galaxy0"]
}
```

`--latest --json`:

```json
{
  "trsToolId": "devteam~fastqc~fastqc",
  "versions": ["0.74+galaxy0"]
}
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | At least one version. |
| `2` | Empty result (TRS tool exists but has no installable versions, or unknown tool id). |
| `3` | HTTP / fetch error. |

## Examples

```bash
gxwf tool-versions devteam/fastqc/fastqc
gxwf tool-versions devteam~fastqc~fastqc --latest
gxwf tool-versions devteam/fastqc/fastqc --json
```

## Gotchas

- **TRS dedupes by version string.** If multiple changesets publish the same `version` (which is legal — the XML version field is not monotonic and not enforced unique), only the last-seen one appears. The other changesets are invisible at this layer. To see the full set of changesets that publish a given version, use `[[tool-revisions]]`. See `[[component-tool-shed-search]]` §3 and §5.
- **`--latest` returns the lexicographically/iteration-order last item, not a semver-parsed maximum.** In practice the TRS list is ordered consistent with the Tool Shed's installable-revisions ordering, so "newest" is normally what you want — but do not assume strict semver semantics.
- **Versions ≠ changesets.** A single TRS version can correspond to multiple changesets in the underlying Mercurial repo. Pinning a workflow for reproducible reinstall requires a `(name, owner, changeset_revision)` triple, not just a version — that is what `[[tool-revisions]]` produces.
- **Stub list endpoint.** The Tool Shed's TRS `/tools` enumerator is unimplemented (returns `[]`). You cannot bulk-list tools via TRS; you must already have a `trsToolId` from search or a known input.

## Pairs with

- `[[tool-search]]` — produces the `trsToolId` consumed here.
- `[[tool-revisions]]` — drills from a `(trsToolId, version)` down to changeset revisions.
- `galaxy-tool-cache add toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/<owner>/<repo>/<tool_id> --version <v>` — caches the picked version's `ParsedTool`.
