# validate-galaxy-workflow

Validate the assembled Galaxy workflow before runtime testing. The Mold owns the terminal validation pass: run [[gxwf validate]], classify workflow-level diagnostics, and route failures back to the responsible authoring phase when possible.

This is separate from [[validate-galaxy-step]] because terminal validation no longer has only one fresh step in scope and should reason over cross-step workflow structure.
