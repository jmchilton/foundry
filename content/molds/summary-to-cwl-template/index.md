# input_artifacts intentionally omitted: this Mold is target-specific and reads
# different upstream summaries/design briefs depending on the source pipeline
# (Nextflow vs paper). Heterogeneous inputs aren't expressible without

# summary-to-cwl-template

Read the original source artifact, the source summary, and all prior source-target design handoffs from the pipeline run. Emit a CWL Workflow skeleton with inputs, outputs, placeholder steps, rough connections, and TODO slots for later implementation Molds.

The interface and data-flow briefs guide the skeleton, but they do not replace source evidence. Treat the prior-step index as the working context: source summary, interface brief, data-flow brief or paper design brief, and any open questions carried forward.
