# summarize-nextflow

Read a Nextflow pipeline source tree (nf-core or ad-hoc DSL2) and emit a structured JSON summary describing its processes, channels, conditionals, containers, parameters, and test fixtures. Source-specific (Nextflow), target-agnostic. The summary is the input to every downstream Mold in the `NEXTFLOW → GALAXY` and `NEXTFLOW → CWL` pipelines: `summary-to-galaxy-data-flow`, `summary-to-cwl-data-flow`, `author-galaxy-tool-wrapper` (for the container/conda block), and `nextflow-test-to-target-tests` (for the test-fixture block).

This Mold owns **only the read-and-structure step**. Every cross-source-and-target translation lives downstream; this Mold is responsible for surfacing what exists in the NF tree honestly, not for reshaping it toward Galaxy or CWL idioms.

The output schema is per-source by design — see [[GXY_SKETCHES_ALIGNMENT]] for why a forced-shared cross-source summary shape was rejected.

## Inputs

The Mold expects:

- A **path or git URL** to the NF pipeline. Local clone is preferred; a git URL triggers a shallow clone the cast skill manages.
- Optional **pin**: tag, branch, or commit SHA. Mirrors `SketchSource` semantics from gxy-sketches.
- Optional **profile hint** (`test`, `test_full`, …) selecting which `conf/<profile>.config` to read for fixtures. Defaults to `test`.

The Mold does **not** accept "summarize this single subworkflow" subset hints; whole-pipeline summary is the unit. Subset summarization is an open question — see Non-goals.

## Outputs

A single JSON document conforming to [[summary-nextflow]] (`content/schemas/summary-nextflow.schema.json`). Sketch shape:

Field-name parity with gxy-sketches (`SketchSource`, `ToolSpec`, `TestDataRef`, `ExpectedOutputRef`) is intentional and load-bearing — see [[GXY_SKETCHES_ALIGNMENT]] §1-3.

## Procedure

The cast skill is **not a single LLM prompt** over the source tree. It is a small program with one or two embedded LLM calls. The split is:

- **Deterministic:** locate files, parse `nextflow.config` and `nextflow_schema.json`, regex-tokenize `process` blocks for typed fields (name, container, conda, declared IO channel names, `when:` guards, `publishDir`), read nf-core module `meta.yml` verbatim, enumerate `include { X } from '...'` for the call graph, resolve biocontainer image strings.
- **LLM-driven:** one-line summary of each process `script:` body, reconciliation of operator-chained channel paths (`A | map | join(B) | groupTuple`) into the workflow `edges[]`, free-text `description` / `notes` fields, IO inference when `meta.yml` is absent and the script is the only signal.

Everything the schema demands as a typed enum or path is deterministic. Free-text fields are LLM. The schema enforces that boundary by typing.

### 1. Detect pipeline shape

Branch shallow on layout:
- nf-core: `nextflow.config` declares `manifest.name = 'nf-core/...'`; `modules/nf-core/`, `subworkflows/nf-core/`, and `nextflow_schema.json` are present. Prefer `meta.yml` as IO ground truth.
- ad-hoc DSL2: no `nextflow_schema.json`, no module `meta.yml`. Falls back to `script:`-block IO inference.
- DSL1: rare; emit the `source` block and exit early with a `warnings[]` entry. Out of scope for v1.

Real pipelines have **multiple named workflow blocks** — typically an anonymous `workflow {}` entrypoint in `main.nf` that wires `PIPELINE_INITIALISATION → NFCORE_<NAME> → PIPELINE_COMPLETION`, plus a substantive named workflow under `workflows/<name>.nf`. Selection rule for the primary `workflow`: pick the named workflow that invokes the most pipeline processes. The anonymous `workflow {}` glue and the `NFCORE_<NAME>` wrapper land in `subworkflows[]`, marked `kind: utility` and `kind: pipeline` respectively.

### 2. Capture provenance

Populate `source` from `git remote get-url`, `git rev-parse HEAD` (or the user-supplied pin), `manifest.name` / `manifest.homePage` / `manifest.version` in `nextflow.config`, and `LICENSE` filename detection. `slug` is kebab of `<owner>-<repo>` for nf-core, kebab of repo basename otherwise.

### 3. Parse parameters and profiles

Read `nextflow.config` `params { ... }` block for defaults. When `nextflow_schema.json` exists (nf-core), prefer it as the source of truth for `type`, `description`, and `required` — it is real JSON Schema, copy verbatim. Enumerate `profiles { ... }` keys.

### 4. Enumerate processes

For each `process <NAME> { ... }` in `main.nf`, `workflows/`, `modules/**`, `subworkflows/**`:
- Pull `container`, `conda`, `publishDir`, `when:` directives **verbatim** into `processes[].container` / `processes[].conda`. Modern nf-core directives are ternary expressions (`workflow.containerEngine == 'singularity' ? <sing-uri> : <docker-uri>`) and file references (`${moduleDir}/environment.yml`); keep the directive text intact and resolve into `tools[]` separately (§5).
- Tokenize the `input:` and `output:` blocks for declared channel names and shapes — typed channels (`tuple val(meta), path(reads)`) become shape strings (`"tuple(meta, [path])"`); arity is preserved as a string, not structured.
- Sweep `include { ... }` statements across the pipeline (`main.nf`, `workflows/`, `subworkflows/**`) to populate `processes[].aliases`. `include { MINIMAP2_ALIGN as MINIMAP2_CONSENSUS }` adds `MINIMAP2_CONSENSUS` to the `MINIMAP2_ALIGN` process's `aliases[]`. The same module can be re-imported under multiple aliases (bacass aliases `MINIMAP2_ALIGN` three times). Edges reference the alias name; the canonical `name` is the FK target.
- Detect `topic: <name>` annotations on outputs (Nextflow 24+ channel topics — nf-core templates emit `tuple(val("${task.process}"), val('toolname'), eval(...)) topic: versions` for version aggregation). Record the topic name in `ChannelIO.topic`.
- Where `meta.yml` exists, **use it** for `description` and IO documentation rather than parsing the `script:` block.
- LLM call (one per process, batchable): summarize the `script:` body in one line. Pass the script verbatim plus the declared IO; ask only for what the tool *does*.

### 5. Build the tool registry

Walk per-process `container` and `conda` directives. **Container directives are usually ternary** — extract both branches:

- The `singularity ?` branch typically yields an `https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/<name>:<version>--<build>` URL → `tools[].singularity`.
- The fallthrough branch typically yields one of:
  - `quay.io/biocontainers/<name>:<version>--<build>` → `tools[].biocontainer`.
  - `biocontainers/<name>:<version>--<build>` (docker.io alias for the same biocontainer image) → `tools[].biocontainer` (same field; both forms are biocontainer images).
  - `community.wave.seqera.io/library/<name>:<version>--<digest>` or `https://community-cr-prod.seqera.io/.../sha256/<digest>/data` → `tools[].wave`.
  - Anything else → `tools[].docker`.

**Conda directives are usually file references** to `${moduleDir}/environment.yml`; read the file and extract its `dependencies:` list. When the list contains a single `bioconda::<name>=<version>` entry, that string becomes `tools[].bioconda`. Legacy literal-string directives (`conda "bioconda::<name>=<version>"`) feed the same field.

Tool name and version are typically derivable from any of the resolved fields. Deduplicate by `(name, version)` across processes; one entry per tool. `processes[].tool` is a foreign key into `tools[].name`. This block is the bridge to `[[author-galaxy-tool-wrapper]]` — it consumes container/conda info to translate into Galaxy `<requirements>`.

### 6. Reconcile the workflow DAG

Enumerate the top-level workflow's `include` statements and channel construction (`Channel.fromPath`, `Channel.fromFilePairs`, `Channel.fromSamplesheet`, `params.*`). For operator chains, the deterministic parser records the *literal* chain (`["map", "join", "groupTuple"]` in `via`). Reconciling chained operators into a coherent `from → to` edge is the second LLM call: given the literal chain, the source channel shape, and the downstream process's declared input shape, emit the resolved edge.

Workflow-level conditionals (`if (params.skip_alignment) { ... }`) emit `conditionals[]` entries with the guard, the branch (`alternate` vs `default`), and the set of processes affected.

Subworkflows split into two kinds:
- `kind: pipeline` — invokes pipeline processes (data-flow contributor). The `NFCORE_<NAME>` wrapper and any nested `subworkflows/local/` that calls processes.
- `kind: utility` — composes free-function calls only (`paramsHelp`, `samplesheetToList`, `completionEmail`). nf-core template subworkflows like `PIPELINE_INITIALISATION` and `PIPELINE_COMPLETION`. `Subworkflow.calls` is empty for utilities; their job is to produce channels (e.g. the validated samplesheet) the primary workflow consumes.

Free-function calls in the workflow body itself (`paramsSummaryMap`, `softwareVersionsToYAML`, `methodsDescriptionText`) are not modeled as processes or subworkflows. Their channel outputs flow into the primary workflow's `channels[]`; the function names are nf-core template idiom, not pipeline-specific signal.

### 7. Surface test fixtures and nf-tests

**Two artifacts come out of this step:** `test_fixtures` (data shape of the selected profile's input) and `nf_tests[]` (every `tests/*.nf.test` file).

**`test_fixtures`** — read `conf/<profile>.config` (default `conf/test.config`) for `params.input` (samplesheet URL) and any other URL-shaped params. For nf-core pipelines, follow the samplesheet URL into the `nf-core/test-datasets` repo if a single fetch is enough to enumerate the file paths it references; otherwise emit the samplesheet URL alone as the input. The samplesheet URL may be a runtime concatenation (`params.pipelines_testdata_base_path + 'foo.csv'`); resolve at config-load semantics and record the resolved URL.

Each entry follows `TestDataRef` (inputs) / `ExpectedOutputRef` (outputs) field names verbatim. The `path` vs `url` rules from gxy-sketches' `TestDataRef` carry over; the "must be under `test_data/`" constraint does **not** — see [[GXY_SKETCHES_ALIGNMENT]] §1.

**`nf_tests[]`** — enumerate every `tests/*.nf.test` file. Real pipelines have one .nf.test per test profile (bacass has 9). For each:

- `name` = the description string passed to `test("...")`.
- `path` = repo-relative file path.
- `profiles[]` = file-level `profile "<name>"` declaration plus any per-test config overrides.
- `params_overrides` = the `when { params { ... } }` block as a key→value map.
- `assert_workflow_success` = `true` when an `assert workflow.success` (or equivalent) clause is present.
- `snapshot` = structured `SnapshotFixture` when an `assert snapshot(...).match()` clause is present, else `null`. nf-core templates use a near-uniform snapshot pattern; extract:
  - `captures[]` = logical names of values passed into `snapshot(...)` (typical set: `succeeded_task_count`, `versions_yml`, `stable_names`, `stable_paths`).
  - `helpers[]` = nf-test helper functions invoked (`getAllFilesFromDir`, `removeNextflowVersion`, ...).
  - `ignore_files[]` = repo-relative paths passed as `ignoreFile:` to helpers (e.g. `tests/.nftignore`).
  - `ignore_globs[]` = inline `ignore: [...]` glob list from helpers.
  - `snap_path` = repo-relative path of the corresponding `.nf.test.snap` file.
- `prose_assertions[]` = any other complex/non-snapshot assertions, summarized to prose strings. Empty for snapshot-only tests (the common nf-core case).

**Consult `references/notes/nextflow-testing.md`** when fixtures use a layout outside `conf/test.config` + nf-test (e.g. legacy `test/` scripts, external test harnesses) or when assertions are non-snapshot equality / regex / `containsString` checks.

### 8. Validate and emit

Validate the assembled object against `schemas/summary-nextflow.schema.json` before emitting. On schema failure, the cast skill should fail loud — the downstream Molds bind to the schema and will produce worse errors later. `additionalProperties: false` at every level catches drift early.

## Revision history

- **rev 4 (2026-05-01)** — second cast against `nf-core/bacass @ 2.5.0` (33 processes, 9 nf-test files, 11 test profiles) exposed two patterns the first cast couldn't see: process aliasing via `include { X as Y }` (six distinct alias-rename patterns in bacass) and the per-test-file structure of nf-test fixtures. §4 grew the alias-sweep rule; §7 split into `test_fixtures` + `nf_tests[]` with structured snapshot extraction. Schema bumped to rev 3 in lockstep. Cast log: `content/log.md` second 2026-05-01 entry.
- **rev 3 (2026-05-01)** — first cast against `nf-core/demo @ 1.1.0` exposed the gaps now folded into §1 (multi-workflow selection rule), §4 (verbatim directive capture, channel topics), §5 (ternary container resolver, file-path conda directives, Wave registry), §6 (utility-vs-pipeline subworkflow split, free-function calls). Schema bumped to rev 2 in lockstep — see `[[summary-nextflow]]`'s revision-2 section. Cast log: `content/log.md` 2026-05-01 entry.
- **rev 2 (2026-04-30)** — substantive body added; output schema declared.
- **rev 1 (2026-04-30)** — stub.

## Caveats baked into the procedure

The procedure assumes — and the cast skill must surface in `warnings[]` when relevant — the following NF realities:

- **DSL1 pipelines are out of scope.** Detected via the absence of DSL2 syntax (`workflow { ... }` block); emit a single warning and exit with the provenance block only.
- **`meta.yml` may lie.** nf-core module `meta.yml` is hand-authored and can drift from the actual `script:` IO. When the LLM-inferred IO disagrees with `meta.yml`, prefer `meta.yml` and surface the disagreement as a warning rather than overriding it.
- **Channel shapes are strings, not structured types.** `"tuple(meta, [path,path])"` is enough for downstream Molds to reason about; structured channel typing is a research project. Downstream Molds that need structure must parse the string.
- **Operator chains are summarized, not executed.** The LLM reconciliation pass is best-effort. Workflows with deeply nested closures (`map { ... }` with substantial Groovy logic) may produce edges flagged with low confidence in `notes`.
- **`include` aliasing is followed one level.** `include { FASTP as TRIM_PROC } from '...'` resolves to `FASTP` in `processes[].name` and the alias is recorded in the call graph. Multi-level aliasing chains are not chased.
- **Test-fixture URLs are not fetched for content validation.** The Mold records URL, role, filetype, and (when present) expected SHA-1; it does not download files to verify they exist.

## Non-goals

- **Subset summarization.** Whole-pipeline only. A single-subworkflow summarizer might land later, but the schema and downstream Molds assume the whole-pipeline shape today.
- **Translation to a target idiom.** This Mold does not produce Galaxy collections, CWL scatter, or any target-shaped data flow. Those live in `[[summary-to-galaxy-data-flow]]` / `[[summary-to-cwl-data-flow]]`.
- **Tool wrapping.** Container/conda info is captured for `[[author-galaxy-tool-wrapper]]` to consume; this Mold never authors a wrapper.
- **Test execution.** Fixtures are described, not run. `[[run-workflow-test]]` owns execution.
- **Schema evolution.** The schema at [[summary-nextflow]] is v1, draft. Adding fields requires evaluating against the §"Reference dispatch" exemplars (rnaseq, sarek, one ad-hoc) before merging.

## Reference dispatch (for casting)

- `output_schemas` → [[summary-nextflow]] (`content/schemas/summary-nextflow.schema.json`) — copied verbatim into the cast bundle's `references/schemas/`. The cast skill validates its emitted JSON against this schema before returning.
- `cli_commands` — none today. Open question whether the Foundry seeds a `content/cli/nextflow/` family for `nextflow config`, `nf-core list`, `nf-test`. The cast skill calls these CLIs at runtime regardless; the question is whether the Foundry carries manpages for them.
- `patterns` — none. Per-source summarization is correctly empty here; this is the first inventory case where a Mold legitimately declares no patterns. Relevant for MOLD_SPEC.
- Research notes — pending: `[[component-nextflow-pipeline-anatomy]]` (DSL2 layout, channel idioms), `[[component-nextflow-containers-and-envs]]` (biocontainers / bioconda equivalence rules), `[[component-nextflow-testing]]` (`conf/test.config`, `nf-core/test-datasets`, nf-test). Body links above render dangling until these are seeded; they are the operational grounding for §4-7. Not packaged into the cast — the casting LLM selects only operationally relevant slices when condensing the procedural body.
- `examples` — pending: `nf-core/rnaseq` (canonical, stresses every section), `nf-core/sarek` (heavy conditional subworkflows; stresses §6's reconciliation), and one ad-hoc DSL2 pipeline (no `meta.yml`, no `nextflow_schema.json`; stresses fallback paths). Bundling vs URL-referencing is open — `rnaseq` is too large to mirror; the corpus-first principle says cite by URL. See [[GXY_SKETCHES_ALIGNMENT]] for the analogous bundle-vs-URL discussion in gxy-sketches.
