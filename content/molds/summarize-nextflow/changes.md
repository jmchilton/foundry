# summarize-nextflow — changes

Revision history for the `summarize-nextflow` Mold. Maintained alongside `index.md` but never packaged into casts.

- **rev 7 (2026-05-02)** — CLI package now sweeps `include { X as Y } from ...` statements across workflow and subworkflow files to populate `processes[].aliases`, tested against bacass repeated imports (`MINIMAP2_ALIGN`, `FASTQC`).
- **rev 6 (2026-05-02)** — CLI package now parses multi-dependency module `environment.yml` files into separate Bioconda-backed `tools[]` entries, tested against bacass modules such as `minimap2/align` and `samtools/sort`.
- **rev 5 (2026-05-02)** — CLI package hardened against `nf-core/bacass` profile config expressions: resolves `params.pipelines_testdata_base_path + '...'`, fetches samplesheet-referenced remote files, hashes them, and optionally localizes them under `--test-data-dir` while preserving original URLs.
- **rev 4 (2026-05-01)** — second cast against `nf-core/bacass @ 2.5.0` (33 processes, 9 nf-test files, 11 test profiles) exposed two patterns the first cast couldn't see: process aliasing via `include { X as Y }` (six distinct alias-rename patterns in bacass) and the per-test-file structure of nf-test fixtures. §4 grew the alias-sweep rule; §7 split into `test_fixtures` + `nf_tests[]` with structured snapshot extraction. Schema bumped to rev 3 in lockstep. Cast log: `content/log.md` second 2026-05-01 entry.
- **rev 3 (2026-05-01)** — first cast against `nf-core/demo @ 1.1.0` exposed the gaps now folded into §1 (multi-workflow selection rule), §4 (verbatim directive capture, channel topics), §5 (ternary container resolver, file-path conda directives, Wave registry), §6 (utility-vs-pipeline subworkflow split, free-function calls). Schema bumped to rev 2 in lockstep — see `[[summary-nextflow]]`'s revision-2 section. Cast log: `content/log.md` 2026-05-01 entry.
- **rev 2 (2026-04-30)** — substantive body added; output schema declared.
- **rev 1 (2026-04-30)** — stub.
