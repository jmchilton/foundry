# discover-shed-tool

Discover whether the Galaxy Tool Shed already publishes a wrapper for the tool a workflow step needs, and resolve the discovery to a `(owner, repo, tool_id, version, changeset_revision)` quintuple that downstream steps can pin and cache.

This Mold is the **Tool Shed leg** of the `discover-or-author` branch in Galaxy-targeting per-step pipelines. On a hit, the cast skill recommends a pin and exits successfully. On a miss (or a low-quality hit), it falls through to `[[author-galaxy-tool-wrapper]]`. The branch itself is harness logic; this Mold owns only the discovery half.

## Inputs

The Mold expects, per step:

- A free-text **need** describing what the step should do (typically a one-line description of the tool, plus any constraints — file format in/out, container language, license preferences).
- Optional **owner hint** (e.g. `devteam`, `iuc`) when the caller has a strong prior.
- Optional **exact-name hint** when the caller knows the canonical XML id.

## Outputs

A structured recommendation object, JSON-shaped:

```json
{
  "status": "hit" | "weak" | "miss",
  "candidate": {
    "owner": "devteam",
    "repoName": "fastqc",
    "toolId": "fastqc",
    "trsToolId": "devteam~fastqc~fastqc",
    "version": "0.74+galaxy0",
    "changesetRevision": "5ec9f6bceaee",
    "score": 12.3,
    "matchedTerms": ["name", "description"]
  },
  "alternates": [ /* up to N runners-up with the same shape */ ],
  "rationale": "single dominant hit on tool name; latest version pinned to newest changeset"
}
```

`status` semantics:
- `hit` — recommend pinning. Caller should cache and proceed.
- `weak` — candidate exists but the cast skill is not confident (e.g. only help-text matched, multiple owners with similar tools, deprecated repo, stale-index suspicion). Caller should confirm or fall through.
- `miss` — no usable hit. Caller falls through to `[[author-galaxy-tool-wrapper]]`.

## Procedure

The cast skill follows the gxwf-shaped discover-and-pin chain. **It does not call the Tool Shed HTTP API directly** — the TS CLI wraps the call sequence and gotchas covered in `[[component-tool-shed-search]]`.

### 1. Search

Issue `[[tool-search]]` with the need's keywords. Start narrow:

```
gxwf tool-search "<keywords>" --json --max-results 10
```

If an owner hint is present, add `--owner <owner>`. If an exact-name hint is present, add `--match-name`. Lowercase the query (the tool index does not lowercase, see `[[component-tool-shed-search]]` §6).

### 2. Triage hits

For each hit, score on:
- **Name match.** Exact match on `toolId` or `name` is a strong signal; help-only matches are weak.
- **Owner reputation.** `iuc` and `devteam` repos are typically maintained; an unfamiliar owner with a single-tool repo is a weaker prior. (No machine-readable approval flag exists — the Tool Shed's `approved` field is dead code.)
- **Recency.** Recent `last_updated` strengthens a hit; very old wrappers can still be valid but warrant the `weak` classification.
- **Duplicates across repos.** Two owners can publish wrappers with the same XML id. Either pick the maintained one or downgrade to `weak` and surface the choice.

Drop hits from deprecated repos when detectable. Note: deprecated repos can still appear in shed search results until the next index rebuild — see `[[component-tool-shed-search]]` §6.

### 3. Resolve to a pinnable version

For the top candidate, list versions:

```
gxwf tool-versions <trsToolId> --json
```

Pick the newest installable version unless the need specifies otherwise (rare: a workflow may pin to a specific historical version for reproducibility). Be aware that **TRS dedupes by version string** — multiple changesets may publish the same version, and only one is visible at this layer.

### 4. Resolve to a changeset

Drill from `(trsToolId, version)` to a concrete changeset:

```
gxwf tool-revisions <trsToolId> --tool-version <v> --latest --json
```

Prefer `--latest` so the newest changeset publishing that version wins (tool versions are not monotonic; two changesets can legally publish the same version with different content). The output's `changesetRevision` is what lands in the workflow's `tool_shed_repository.changeset_revision` for reproducible reinstall.

### 5. Classify and emit

Combine the scored hit and the resolved pin into the recommendation object above:
- One dominant hit + clean version+changeset resolution → `hit`.
- Multiple plausible hits, ambiguous owner, deprecated suspicion, or only-help-text match → `weak` with the leading candidate plus alternates.
- No usable hit → `miss`.

## Caveats baked into the procedure

The procedure assumes — and the cast skill must surface in its rationale when relevant — the following Tool Shed realities (full detail in `[[component-tool-shed-search]]` §6):

- **Indexes are stale by design.** A freshly published tool may not appear; a deprecated tool may still appear. Treat absence as soft evidence, not proof.
- **Wildcard `*term*` wrapping** disables stemming; spelling matters. Try alternate phrasings before declaring `miss`.
- **No EDAM in shed search** — semantic queries that work in Galaxy's installed-toolbox search will not work here. Stick to lexical name/keyword queries.
- **Same XML id across repos.** Hits collapse only on `(repoName, owner)`; expect duplicates that need triage.
- **Repo-level discovery is a different surface.** For "find me the *package* that contains a tool about X" with server-side `owner:` / `category:` keywords, `gxwf repo-search` is the right command — out of scope for this Mold but a known sibling.

## Non-goals

- **Authoring.** This Mold never produces a tool wrapper. On `miss`, the harness's `discover-or-author` branch fall-through invokes `[[author-galaxy-tool-wrapper]]`.
- **Caching.** This Mold emits a pin recommendation. The caller (or the next phase) runs `galaxy-tool-cache add toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/<owner>/<repo>/<tool_id> --version <v>` to populate the cache.
- **Galaxy-instance discovery.** Hitting a running Galaxy server's installed-tool index (EDAM-aware, panel-aware) is a different mechanism — the future `discover-tool-via-galaxy-api` Mold. The contrast is sketched in `[[component-tool-shed-search]]` §4.
- **Test-data resolution.** Out of scope; handled by the `test-data-resolution` branch elsewhere in the pipeline.

## Reference dispatch (for casting)

- `cli_commands` ([[tool-search]], [[tool-versions]], [[tool-revisions]]) — cast as JSON sidecars per the per-action manpage dispatch (see `COMPILATION_PIPELINE.md`). The cast skill calls these as subprocess commands at runtime.
- `[[component-tool-shed-search]]` — research note. **Not** packaged into the cast skill. It is the Foundry-internal grounding for the gotchas listed above; casting selects only the operationally relevant slices when condensing the procedural body.
