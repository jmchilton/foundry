# summarize-galaxy-tool

Read a cached Galaxy `ParsedTool` object for an existing wrapper and emit a compact tool summary that downstream step implementation can bind to. This Mold runs after [[discover-shed-tool]] has selected a Tool Shed pin and after the caller has populated `galaxy-tool-cache` for that pin.

This Mold owns the **wrapper summarization** step only. It does not search the Tool Shed, choose a version, author XML, or decide how a workflow step should use the wrapper. Its job is to preserve the wrapper's executable contract: identity, command shape, inputs, outputs, requirements, tests, and any conditional or data-table behavior that could affect binding.

The v1 input-source decision is [[galaxy-tool-summary-input-source]]: read cached ParsedTool JSON, using raw XML only as supporting evidence when the cache object is lossy or ambiguous.

## Inputs

The Mold expects:

- A Tool Shed pin from [[discover-shed-tool]]: `tool_shed_url`, `owner`, `repo`, `tool_id`, `version`, and `changeset_revision`.
- A `galaxy-tool-cache` directory containing the cached ParsedTool JSON for that pin.
- Optional raw XML source for ambiguity checks, normally fetched through cache metadata rather than treated as the primary input.
- Optional step intent from the caller, used only to prioritize which wrapper details to explain; it must not change the wrapper facts.

## Outputs

A single JSON document conforming to [[galaxy-tool-summary]] — the deterministic manifest emitted by `galaxy-tool-cache summarize` from `@galaxy-tool-util/cli`. Top-level fields: `schema_version`, `tool_id`, `tool_version`, `cache_key`, `source`, `artifacts`, `parsed_tool`, `input_schemas`, `warnings`. The `parsed_tool` subtree is the upstream [[parsed-tool]] payload verbatim; `input_schemas.workflow_step` and `input_schemas.workflow_step_linked` carry generated JSON Schemas describing the tool's inputs at workflow-step authoring time.

This Mold does not hand-author the manifest — it invokes `galaxy-tool-cache summarize` against a cache populated for the Tool Shed pin. Wrapper-derived facts that are not yet exposed by upstream `ParsedTool` (currently: requirements, containers, stdio) flow into the manifest additively as Galaxy upstream extends `ParsedTool`; no Foundry-side schema change is needed when they ship.

## Procedure

### 1. Load the cached wrapper

Locate the ParsedTool JSON in the configured `galaxy-tool-cache` directory using the Tool Shed pin. Fail early if the cache entry is missing; do not silently re-search the Tool Shed.

Confirm the cached identity matches the requested pin. If the cache exposes a tool id or version that conflicts with the pin, emit a hard failure rather than summarizing the wrong wrapper.

### 2. Capture identity and provenance

Populate `source` from the discovery pin and cache metadata. Populate `tool` from the parsed wrapper identity fields, not from the search hit. Search hits can omit version and changeset detail.

Keep both forms when they differ:

- Short XML `id` for human matching.
- Fully qualified installed Tool Shed id for gxformat2 step binding.

### 3. Extract executable requirements

Read `<requirements>` into structured package/container requirements. Preserve requirement `type`, `name`, `version`, and any container URI or resolver hints exposed by the cache.

Do not invent Bioconda equivalences here. Equivalence inference belongs to [[author-galaxy-tool-wrapper]] when authoring a new XML wrapper. Existing wrapper summaries report what the wrapper declares.

### 4. Summarize command and failure behavior

Preserve the command template enough for downstream binding to understand which inputs and parameters are consumed. Record strict-shell, stdio regexes, exit-code handling, environment variables, and dynamic output behavior when present.

The command summary should be readable, but lossy prose is not enough. Keep template fragments and wrapper flags where they affect required inputs, output discovery, or runtime failure classification.

### 5. Enumerate inputs

For every wrapper input parameter, emit:

- `name` and label/help text when available.
- Parameter kind (`data`, `data_collection`, `select`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `text`, conditional section, repeat, section).
- Required/optional/default semantics.
- Datatypes, collection types, and multiple-value behavior.
- Select choices and dynamic options when statically available.
- Data-table references separately from user-provided parameters.

Nested conditionals must preserve branch ownership. Do not flatten `when` branches into independent parameters without recording the controlling selector and branch value.

### 6. Enumerate outputs

For every output and collection output, emit:

- Output name, datatype, label, and `from_work_dir` or discovery rule when available.
- Conditional output ownership.
- Dynamic output collection shape and naming rules.
- Relationship to input collections when the wrapper maps over or preserves identifiers.

If output discovery depends on runtime filenames, record that as a warning for downstream test and debug Molds.

### 7. Capture tests and citations

Summarize wrapper tests into input fixture expectations, parameter settings, and output assertions. Do not treat wrapper tests as workflow tests; they are evidence about legal parameter combinations and output behavior.

Preserve citations, help text, and upstream URLs when present because they help resolve ambiguous wrappers during review.

### 8. Emit warnings

Warnings should identify missing or lossy surfaces, especially:

- ParsedTool JSON omits raw XML behavior that affects binding.
- Conditional inputs cannot be reconstructed completely.
- Dynamic data-table options require Galaxy instance configuration.
- Output discovery is runtime-dependent.
- Tests are absent or too thin to confirm key outputs.

## Non-goals

- **Tool discovery.** Use [[discover-shed-tool]] before this Mold.
- **Wrapper authoring.** Use [[author-galaxy-tool-wrapper]] when no acceptable wrapper exists.
- **Step implementation.** [[implement-galaxy-tool-step]] binds abstract workflow intent to this summary.
- **Installed-Galaxy-only wrappers.** Deferred until a Galaxy API discovery/input path exists.
