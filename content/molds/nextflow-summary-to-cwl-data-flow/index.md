# nextflow-summary-to-cwl-data-flow

Read a Nextflow summary plus the preceding CWL interface brief and emit a reviewable Markdown data-flow brief. Capture abstract operations, CWL scatter/gather choices, value transformations, unresolved CommandLineTool needs, confidence, and open questions.

The output is not a concrete CWL Workflow. [[summary-to-cwl-template]] turns this handoff and the interface brief into a skeleton.
