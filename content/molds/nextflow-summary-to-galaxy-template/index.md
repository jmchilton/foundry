# nextflow-summary-to-galaxy-template

Read the original Nextflow source artifact, the `summary-nextflow.json` summary, the Nextflow-to-Galaxy interface brief, and the Nextflow-to-Galaxy data-flow brief. Emit a gxformat2 skeleton with workflow inputs, workflow outputs, placeholder steps, rough connections, and TODO slots for later implementation Molds.

The interface and data-flow briefs guide the skeleton, but they do not replace source evidence. Treat the prior-step index as the working context: Nextflow source, source summary, interface brief, data-flow brief, and any open questions carried forward.
