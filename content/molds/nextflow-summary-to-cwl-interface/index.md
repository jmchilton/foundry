# nextflow-summary-to-cwl-interface

Read a Nextflow summary and emit a reviewable Markdown interface brief for a CWL Workflow. Capture workflow inputs, workflow outputs, labels, array/record/File shapes, checkpoint outputs worth exposing for tests, source-summary provenance, confidence, and open questions.

The output is a design handoff consumed by [[nextflow-summary-to-cwl-data-flow]], [[summary-to-cwl-template]], and later test-plan work.
