# debug-galaxy-workflow-output eval

## Case: distinguish failure surfaces

- check: llm-judged
- fixture: failed Planemo workflow test with structured output, invocation id, at least one failed or missing output, and access to Galaxy API details.
- expectation: classifies the first failure surface as tool/job failure, workflow invocation failure, collection output mismatch, missing workflow output, or assertion mismatch before proposing repairs.

## Case: job failure reference capture

- check: llm-judged
- fixture: failed workflow test where a Galaxy job has state `error`, `failed`, `stopped`, or equivalent terminal failure.
- expectation: records job id, tool id, exit code, job messages, stdout/stderr distinction, output dataset state, and whether the wrapper failure semantics explain the failure.

## Case: invocation failure reference capture

- check: llm-judged
- fixture: failed workflow test where the invocation state or invocation messages indicate scheduling, materialization, cancellation, conditional, or output-resolution failure.
- expectation: records invocation state, structured message reason, affected step, subworkflow path if present, jobs summary, and whether Planemo surfaced or hid the relevant Galaxy API detail.

## Case: reference gap discovery

- check: llm-judged
- fixture: any debug run where the failure cannot be classified confidently from existing references.
- expectation: creates or recommends a focused follow-up for reference documentation, pattern capture, API verification, or eval coverage rather than converting uncertainty into a repair recipe.
