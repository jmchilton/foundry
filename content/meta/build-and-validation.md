summary: "How authored Foundry source is checked, generated, cast, assembled, rendered, and kept current."
---

This record owns the transformations from authored source to checked or generated output. It answers **what runs, in what order, and what proves the result is current?** Component ownership belongs to [[code-architecture]] and file placement to [[repository-layout]].

## Authoring loop

```text

   └──► build the Astro site ──collection schema + route rendering
```

Authors change source notes, registries, schema implementations, or code. Generated files are refreshed through their owning command rather than edited directly.

## Static validation

`npm run validate` invokes `foundry-build validate --root .`. Validation proceeds in layers:

1. discover notes through the shared collection table;
2. parse frontmatter and validate the note against its kind's strict zod schema;
3. check dates, paths, note shapes, and companion contracts;
4. load tag, reference, and runtime-artifact registries and enforce membership and coherence;
5. build the shared wiki-link map and resolve frontmatter and body links; an unresolved link is an error wherever it is written, on every kind that declares the field;
6. run kind-specific checks for Molds, Patterns, Pipelines, schemas, CLI notes, prompts, research notes, and artifacts;
7. run cross-note checks such as typed-reference compatibility, pipeline phase resolution, and artifact producer/consumer ordering — where inputs sharing a `role` are alternatives one producer satisfies, and a producer may be a Mold output or an explicitly registered runtime mode;
8. run `validateUnroutedContent`, which errors on markdown under `content/` that no collection claims, no directory note owns, and `NOT_NOTES` does not declare.

Step 8 is what closes the walk. Steps 1–7 check the files the routing table found; step 8 checks that the table found everything there was to find. [[content-model]] owns the three-way accounting it enforces.

Errors block. Warnings identify advisory quality concerns. Casting refuses to proceed from a Mold that fails static validation.

## Generated navigation and manifests

The authoring CLI generates several committed projections:

- `content/Dashboard.md` from configured dashboard sections;
- `content/Index.md` from the current note inventory;
- the README corpus statistics block;
- `packages/gxwf-foundry-note-schema/src/types/kinds.generated.json` from assembled kind definitions.

Each generator has a `--check` command (`check:dashboard`, `check:index`, `check:readme`, `check:kinds`) that regenerates in memory and fails on byte drift. The authored notes and kind definitions remain authoritative.

## Casting

`foundry-build cast` reads one Mold, validates it, resolves its typed references, dispatches each reference according to the reference contract, and writes a target-specific bundle under `casts/<target>/`. A cast includes provenance recording the Mold hash, resolved reference hashes, target/model information where applicable, and timestamp.

Casting treats source and output as separate lifecycles:

- Molds and referenced notes are durable authored source.
- `SKILL.md`, copied references, sidecars, `_provenance.json`, and verification reports are generated outputs.
- `_feedback.md` is generated from the registered feedback protocol note when the instance declares the feedback runtime artifact.
- Evaluation and refinement companions remain Foundry-maintainer material unless their declared disposition says otherwise.

[[casting]] and [[cast-walkthrough]] own the semantic details.

## Pipeline assembly

`foundry-build assemble-pipeline` projects a Pipeline's phase spine into a lightweight `pipeline-<slug>` harness skill. It resolves phase Molds, expands supported branch routing, records `_assembly.json`, and prepares a per-run working-directory contract. When the feedback runtime artifact is registered, the assembly also exposes `--feedback` and the ledger lifecycle derived from the same registry declaration. The output is a test-drive convenience, not the production harness architecture described in [[harness-pipelines]].

`make check-assemble-pipelines` is the drift gate for committed assemblies.

## Agent-skill conformance

`foundry-build test-skill` is the opt-in first layer of the external Pipeline evaluation harness. It invokes one committed cast skill through the pinned Pi RPC runtime with an explicit `/skill:<name>` activation. Every run uses a fresh process, worker directory, and Pi configuration directory; disables session, context-file, extension, prompt-template, and ambient skill discovery; stages a dereferenced copy of the selected skill plus only the declared inputs; and retains raw JSONL, stderr, usage, runtime identity, input and artifact hashes, and a versioned `run.json`. The CLI's default run directory is unique and rooted in the operating system's temporary directory rather than the checkout; `--run-dir` remains an explicit override. The `foundry_subagent` extension always derives expected artifacts from the selected cast's `_provenance.json`, so the parent agent cannot replace or suppress the contract being evaluated. The runner applies the cast's `_verify.json` process checks after execution when it contains a validator for an expected artifact.

Local mode provides process and context isolation but is not a security boundary. Container mode runs the whole Pi RPC worker in a disposable Docker container resolved to an immutable image ID. A dereferenced copy of the selected cast and copied declared inputs are the only read-only host mounts; the run output directory is the only read-write host mount; Pi configuration and temporary storage are ephemeral tmpfs mounts; and no checkout path is mounted. The normalized record captures the effective image, complete mount manifest, network policy, and credential environment-variable allowlist. The image pins both Pi and the Foundry runtime CLI required by the pilot skill, and the runner rejects images whose compatibility labels do not match those pins. Deterministic Pipeline sequencing and independent qualitative grading remain staged follow-up in [issue #476](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/issues/476). Pi is exactly pinned by the optional `@galaxy-foundry/pi-harness` tooling; ordinary validation, casting, assembly, and site builds do not start it or require provider credentials.

## Site build

The Astro application loads every note collection from the shared collection table and applies the same assembled schemas as repository validation. It builds:

- type-specific browse and detail routes;
- the design-record reading surface;
- tags, backlinks, wiki links, and raw text endpoints;
- specialized renderers for Molds, Patterns, Pipelines, schemas, research, and CLI references;
- cast and usage surfaces derived from committed artifacts.

The raw endpoints follow one rule: **every note is served, and so is every file beside one** — companions, `refinements/` entries, `examples/` fixtures, vendored sidecars. Nothing adjacent to a note is withheld, because the repository is public and an unserved file is hidden from an agent reading the site and from nobody else. The path carries the whole filename rather than a stem, which is what lets a `.yml` or `.prompt` sidecar have a URL at all.

`npm run site:build` performs the production static build. GitHub Pages deployment consumes that output; the site is never an authoring source.

## Vendored and fixture maintenance

Vendored upstream artifacts have explicit sync commands and checked provenance. `npm run check:vendored` detects upstream-artifact drift. Planemo CLI metadata and its test-report schema are refreshed with `make sync-planemo*` targets and checked without requiring Planemo during ordinary validation.

`workflow-fixtures/` is a generated research workspace. Fixture declarations are authored; cloned or converted pipelines, IWC trees, and skeletons are materialized on demand and remain gitignored. These outputs support surveys and tests but never become content implicitly.

## CI gates

Pull requests and `main` run proportional checks across:

- content validation and drift generators;
- root and package Vitest suites;
- TypeScript and Astro type checking;
- package builds, formatting, and linting;
- cast, assembly, vendored-artifact, and CLI-reference drift checks;
- the static site build;
- verification workflows where their fixtures apply.

The architectural rule is simple: every committed projection must have a reproducible producer and a check mode, while every non-deterministic cast must carry provenance sufficient to identify its inputs.

## Tracked tooling follow-up

Root authoring commands currently run TypeScript through `tsx`. A possible migration to
precompiled bins is tracked in [issue #201](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/issues/201);
until that contract changes, the root scripts remain supported entry points rather than an
accidental development-only path.
