# Parameter: compose runtime text parameter

## Tool

Use `toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/compose_text_param/compose_text_param/0.1.1` when a downstream tool parameter must be a runtime-built text string rather than a fixed literal.

The tool concatenates ordered components into `out1`, which then connects into text-like downstream parameters such as `cond`, `columnList`, `regions`, `text_input`, or read-group IDs.

## When to reach for it

Use this when constants and runtime values must become one exact string: `c4 >= <threshold>`, `cN,cM`, genomic ranges, read-group IDs, or config lines.

Use it before tools whose target parameter is text but whose value depends on workflow inputs or upstream scalar parameter steps.

Do not use this for enum-to-flag mapping; use [[map-workflow-enum-to-tool-parameter]].

Do not use this for tabular string computation that should remain a dataset column; use [[tabular-compute-new-column]] or a tabular text-processing pattern.

## Operation Boundary

This pattern covers composing a text parameter at workflow runtime from ordered literal and connected scalar pieces.

It does not cover reading scalar values from files, mapping enum values to dialects, row-wise tabular string computation, or custom wrapper authoring.

## Parameters

- `components`: ordered repeat; order is the output string order.
- `components[].param_type.select_param_type`: observed values include `text`, `integer`, and `float`.
- Literal text components carry `component_value` as the exact string to insert.
- Runtime components carry `component_value: { __class__: ConnectedValue }` and have a matching `in:` connection such as `components_1|param_type|component_value`.
- Output `out1`: connect to the downstream text parameter.

Preserve spaces, commas, prefixes, and comparison operators exactly in literal chunks. The composer does not understand downstream syntax.

## Idiomatic Shapes

Filter predicate:

```text
"c4 >= " + integer threshold -> Filter1.cond
```

Dynamic column list:

```text
"c" + integer + ",c" + integer -> Cut1.columnList
```

Config line:

```text
"pull_coord1_rate = " + float -> add_line_to_file.text_input
```

Region or read-group string:

```text
runtime start/end text + literal separators or pool suffix -> downstream text parameter
```

These snippets are conceptual; use the gxformat2 exemplars for exact serialized shapes.

## Pitfalls

- Component order is semantic. Reordering components without matching connections changes the generated string.
- Literal whitespace matters. Leading and trailing spaces in config-line chunks are meaningful.
- There is no downstream syntax validation. `compose_text_param` can build an invalid `Filter1.cond`, invalid `Cut1.columnList`, or invalid genomic range.
- Connected text is not a dataset. Connect `out1` to a tool parameter, not a dataset input.
- Do not replace [[map-workflow-enum-to-tool-parameter]]. If the operation is mapping `stranded` to a flag or snippet, map first; compose only when the final task is concatenation.
- Do not confuse row-wise string construction with runtime parameter composition. If each input row needs a computed string, use tabular tools.
