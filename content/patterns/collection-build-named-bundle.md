# Collection: build named bundle

## Tool

Use Galaxy built-in `__BUILD_LIST__`.

The survey found two useful sub-cases:

- Manual-id output bundle: collect related outputs into a named result collection for organization or publishing.
- Identifier-id fan-in: assemble tool outputs into one collection for a downstream tool that expects collection input.

`__MERGE_COLLECTION__` is the sibling operation when the inputs are already collections. Current corpus evidence does not justify a standalone merge pattern.

## When to reach for it

Use `__BUILD_LIST__` when you start with individual datasets or individual output connections and need a Galaxy `list`.

Use manual identifiers when element names should be human-authored result labels. Use inherited identifiers when downstream semantics already know those names.

Do not use this to concatenate file contents. Use [[tabular-concatenate-collection-to-table]] when the goal is one combined tabular dataset.

## Parameters

The main knob is the element identifier source:

```yaml
tool_id: __BUILD_LIST__
tool_state:
  elements:
    - src: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
      id_cond:
        id_select: manual
        identifier: bray_curtis_pcoa_results
```

- `id_select: manual`: human-authored names for output bundles.
- `id_select: identifier`: inherit source identifiers for downstream fan-in.
- `id_select: idx`: positional/default style; avoid when element identity matters.

## Pitfalls

- Manual identifiers become collection element identifiers and may appear in output histories or reports.
- Manual bundles group outputs; they do not align rows, merge contents, or validate common keys.
- Use inherited identifiers only when source names are meaningful.
- Prefer `__MERGE_COLLECTION__` only when inputs are already collections.
