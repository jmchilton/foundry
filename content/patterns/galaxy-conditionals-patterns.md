# Galaxy: conditionals patterns

This is the runtime-facing map for Galaxy conditional workflow choices. Use it before loading raw survey notes. The survey remains evidence backing; the operation and recipe pages are the actionable references.

## Direct Gates

- [[conditional-run-optional-step]] — expose or derive a boolean, connect it as `inputs.when`, and use `when: $(inputs.when)` to skip optional steps.
- [[conditional-gate-on-nonempty-result]] — compute a boolean from empty/non-empty dataset or collection state before gating downstream reporting/export. The MGnify recipe is corpus-backed but clunky pending verified-pattern workflow work.

## Routes and Fallbacks

- [[conditional-route-between-alternative-outputs]] — run one of several `when`-gated alternatives, then merge possible outputs with `pick_value`.
- [[conditional-transform-or-pass-through]] — optionally transform a value, then use `pick_value` to choose transformed output or original fallback.

## Not Conditionals

- [[collection-cleanup-after-mapover-failure]] — use collection filters when empty or failed mapped elements should be dropped or replaced. This is collection-state cleanup, not a `when` gate.
- `__FILTER_NULL__` — catalog capability for null outputs after conditional steps, but no IWC-backed pattern candidate in the conditionals survey. Zero uptake is not itself an anti-pattern call.
