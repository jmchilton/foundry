# Collection: flatten after fan-out

## Tool

Use Galaxy built-in `__FLATTEN__`.

The corpus-attested operation is simple: collapse a nested collection such as `list:list` or `list:paired` into a flat `list` when the outer grouping axis has served its purpose.

## When to reach for it

Use this after a tool fans out within each sample/group and downstream no longer needs that grouping.

Typical shape: a domain tool maps over a collection and produces nested outputs, the outer axis becomes only organizational, and `__FLATTEN__` produces one flat list for pooling, relabeling, reporting, or MultiQC-style consumption.

Do not flatten if downstream needs to know which outer sample/group produced each element.

## Parameters

```yaml
tool_id: __FLATTEN__
tool_state:
  input: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
```

The useful authoring decision is input collection type and whether the outer axis is truly no longer meaningful.

## Pitfalls

- Flattening discards structure. Element identifiers may retain hints, but the Galaxy collection type no longer encodes the outer axis.
- Flatten only after the outer axis is done.
- If flattened identifiers collide or become unreadable, add an explicit relabel step.
- Do not use Apply Rules for plain flattening; the survey found `__FLATTEN__` dominates simple cases.
