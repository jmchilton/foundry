# Tabular: relabel by row counter

## Tool

`toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_awk_tool`. This is the operation-named awk recipe for replacing row content with deterministic labels derived from `NR`.

## When to reach for it

Use this when a workflow needs synthetic row labels like `sample_0`, `sample_1`, ... or `sample_1`, `sample_2`, ... based only on input row order.

Do not use this for simple computed columns; use [[tabular-compute-new-column]]. Do not use this when labels should come from collection element identifiers; use collection-aware provenance such as [[tabular-concatenate-collection-to-table]].

## Parameters

- `code`: awk program. A one-line quoted string is enough for this operation.
- `infile`: connected input.
- `variables`: usually `[]` in awk examples.

The corpus exemplar uses `toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_awk_tool/9.5+galaxy3`.

## Idiomatic shapes

Corpus-observed `sample_0` first row:

```yaml
tool_id: toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_awk_tool/9.5+galaxy3
tool_state:
  code: '{gsub( $0 ,"sample_" (NR-1)); print}'
  infile: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
  variables: []
```

Anchored by the MAGs binning evaluation IWC exemplar.

Clearer equivalent for new whole-row replacement:

```yaml
tool_state:
  code: '{print "sample_" (NR-1)}'
  infile: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
  variables: []
```

One-based labels:

```yaml
tool_state:
  code: '{print "sample_" NR}'
  infile: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
  variables: []
```

Keep a header and relabel only data rows:

```yaml
tool_state:
  code: 'NR==1 {print; next} {print "sample_" (NR-1)}'
  infile: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
  variables: []
```

## Pitfalls

- **Zero-based vs one-based labels.** Corpus emits `sample_0` first because it uses `NR-1`. Use `NR` for `sample_1`.
- **Headers shift counters.** Decide whether the first line is preserved, dropped, or counted before picking `NR` vs `NR-1`.
- **Avoid `gsub($0, ...)` for new work.** It works in the exemplar, but treats the current row as a regex pattern. `print "sample_" ...` is clearer when replacing the whole row.
- **Whole-row replacement destroys original columns.** Only use when downstream wants labels only.
- **Row order becomes semantic.** Any upstream sort or filter changes assigned sample numbers.
- **No collection provenance.** If labels should come from element identifiers, do not synthesize them from row order.
