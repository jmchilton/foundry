# Collection: harmonize by sortlist from identifiers

## Tool

Use Galaxy built-in `__SORTLIST__` with `sort_type: file`, driven by an identifier list from `collection_element_identifiers`.

This is the corpus-attested harmonization recipe. `__HARMONIZELISTS__` exists in the collection-tools catalog, but the survey found zero corpus uptake.

## When to reach for it

Use this when two sibling collections must line up by element identifier before downstream map-over, zip-like pairing, or parallel per-sample processing.

The usual shape is: extract identifiers from the reference collection, feed that identifier file into `__SORTLIST__`, and sort the sibling collection with `sort_type: file`.

Do not use this if unmatched elements must be preserved; file-driven sort can also filter.

This page is about order harmonization. Use [[sync-collections-by-identifier]] when membership alone is the issue and [[regex-relabel-via-tabular]] when labels need cleanup.

## Parameters

Identifier extraction has no meaningful knobs. For sort:

```yaml
tool_id: __SORTLIST__
tool_state:
  input: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
  sort_type: file
  sort_file: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
```

The `sort_file` must be the identifiers of the collection whose order should be copied.

## Pitfalls

- This can drop elements. Treat `sort_type: file` as reorder-plus-intersect unless you have verified behavior for missing identifiers.
- The reference collection defines truth. If the identifier file comes from the wrong sibling, downstream pairing silently follows the wrong axis.
- Extract identifiers after upstream relabel, filter, or flatten operations, not before.
- Mention `__HARMONIZELISTS__` only as the absent catalog alternative; do not recommend it from corpus evidence.
