# Collection: relabel via rules and find/replace

## Tool

Use this narrow chain when relabeling is embedded in structural collection reshape:

1. A domain tool fans out into a nested collection with noisy identifiers.
2. `__APPLY_RULES__` swaps or regroups collection nesting.
3. `collection_element_identifiers` extracts current identifiers.
4. `tp_find_and_replace` cleans those identifiers.
5. `__RELABEL_FROM_FILE__` applies the cleaned identifiers.
6. A second `__APPLY_RULES__` may restore the downstream grouping.

## When to reach for it

Use this when a tool creates machine-generated names, downstream steps need meaningful segment/sample identifiers, and collection nesting must be regrouped around those identifiers.

Do not generalize this page to every Apply Rules relabel. The strong citation is one influenza workflow. Prefer [[regex-relabel-via-tabular]] unless the workflow has this structural fan-out problem.

This page is about relabeling inside a reshape. Use [[collection-swap-nesting-with-apply-rules]] for pure nesting swaps and [[regex-relabel-via-tabular]] for relabel-only cleanup.

## Parameters

For the Apply Rules portions, expose `identifier0` and `identifier1`, then map list identifiers in the required order. The exact persisted `rules` blob is workflow API state; author the logical rule sequence, then validate gxformat2.

Run `collection_element_identifiers` on the reshaped collection level whose labels need cleanup. Use `tp_find_and_replace` only for the identifier cleanup. Apply the cleaned list with `__RELABEL_FROM_FILE__`.

## Idiomatic shape

Conceptual chain:

```yaml
# domain fan-out tool, e.g. BAM split by reference
# -> __APPLY_RULES__            # regroup list:list axes
# -> collection_element_identifiers
# -> tp_find_and_replace        # clean generated labels
# -> __RELABEL_FROM_FILE__      # apply cleaned labels
# -> __APPLY_RULES__            # regroup again if downstream needs it
```

## Pitfalls

- Do not flatten away the axis you need. The point is preserving both sample and segment/reference axes.
- Extract identifiers at the right level; extracting before the first Apply Rules step can capture the wrong labels.
- Rewrite only tool-added noise. A broad regex can merge distinct segment/sample identifiers.
- `__RELABEL_FROM_FILE__` changes names only. Apply Rules carries the shape change.

## Exemplars (IWC)

- `$IWC_FORMAT2/virology/influenza-isolates-consensus-and-subtyping/influenza-consensus-and-subtyping.gxwf.yml:34-38` — canonical dense segment: `bamtools_split_ref` output goes through Apply Rules, identifier extraction, find/replace, relabeling, then Apply Rules again.
- `$IWC_FORMAT2/virology/influenza-isolates-consensus-and-subtyping/influenza-consensus-and-subtyping.gxwf.yml:14,39,43` — same workflow repeatedly uses the Apply Rules swap-nesting shape around sample/segment collections.
