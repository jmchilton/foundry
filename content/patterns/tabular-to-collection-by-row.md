# Tabular: to collection by row

## Tool

Use `toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/split_file_to_collection/split_file_to_collection/0.5.2`.

The IWC-attested shape is `split_by: col`: split a tabular file into a dataset collection, one element per row or key. `id_col` chooses the column that becomes the element identifier. `match_regex` and `sub_regex` clean or extract that identifier.

This is the inverse of [[tabular-concatenate-collection-to-table]], where `collapse_dataset` turns a collection into one tabular dataset.

## When to reach for it

Use this when a single manifest, sample sheet, accession list, or combined results table must become a collection so the next tool can map over each row/key.

Do not use this when the input is already a collection. Do not use this for collection-to-table row-binding; use [[tabular-concatenate-collection-to-table]].

## Parameters

```yaml
tool_id: toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/split_file_to_collection/split_file_to_collection/0.5.2
tool_state:
  input: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
  split_parms:
    split_by: col
    id_col: "1"
    match_regex: (.*)
    sub_regex: \1
```

- `split_parms.split_by: col`: split by a tabular column.
- `split_parms.id_col`: 1-indexed column whose value becomes the collection element identifier.
- `split_parms.match_regex` / `sub_regex`: regex and replacement used to produce the final identifier.

## Pitfalls

- `id_col` is 1-indexed.
- Pick a stable, unique identifier column; duplicate values produce ambiguous collection elements.
- Regex cleanup is downstream metadata cleanup, not cosmetic only.
- Headers matter. Ensure each split element gets the header behavior the downstream tool expects.
