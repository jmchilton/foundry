# Collection: unbox singleton

## Tool

Use Galaxy built-in `__EXTRACT_DATASET__` with `which: first`.

This page covers the corpus-dominant shape: an upstream step emits a known one-element collection, but the downstream step or workflow output expects a dataset.

## When to reach for it

Use this when the collection has exactly one meaningful element by construction.

Common IWC context: QC/reporting tools emit images, stats, or HTML outputs as singleton collections after map-over or conditional branching. The workflow immediately extracts the first element so ordinary dataset-consuming steps can use it.

Do not use this to reshape a real multi-element collection. If `N > 1` is meaningful, preserve collection semantics or use a collection-aware operation.

## Parameters

- `input`: connected collection.
- `which: first`: singleton unboxing.

The same tool supports by-index and by-identifier extraction, but the survey signal is overwhelmingly the singleton case. Prefer by-identifier over by-index if you genuinely need arbitrary element extraction.

## Idiomatic shape

```yaml
tool_id: __EXTRACT_DATASET__
tool_state:
  input: { __class__: ConnectedValue }
  which: first
```

Read this as an assertion: this collection has exactly one useful element here.

## Pitfalls

- `which: first` hides bugs if the collection unexpectedly has multiple elements.
- Do not use it as collection filtering; selecting a named element is a different operation.
- Check conditional branches. Singleton extraction often follows single-sample vs multi-sample routing.
- Once unboxed, collection element identifiers are no longer available as collection metadata.
