### Patch Changes

- [#486](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/pull/486) [`0457a1b`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/commit/0457a1ba2933a64882515523cfcf6496130fc546) Thanks [@jmchilton](https://github.com/jmchilton)! - Ignore commented Nextflow declarations and expose subworkflow aliases so summaries preserve the live workflow topology.

- Updated dependencies [[`0457a1b`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/commit/0457a1ba2933a64882515523cfcf6496130fc546)]:

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/pull/240) [`87f9a46`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/commit/87f9a4617510f79e9fae02117694b5aa8c1176d1) Thanks [@jmchilton](https://github.com/jmchilton)! - Add browser-safe `./meta` subpath export (`foundryCliMeta`) so consumers can render per-subcommand documentation from static program metadata without invoking commander or shelling out to `foundry --help`. The bin is refactored: `buildProgram()` is now importable from `@galaxy-foundry/gxwf-foundry`'s internal `program.ts`, and the bin entry point is a thin parse-argv shim.

- [#483](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/pull/483) [`d9e6f1a`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/commit/d9e6f1af7f90021ff5033a1d9c32541cd2ae2cdc) Thanks [@jmchilton](https://github.com/jmchilton)! - Publish the gxwf-specific Foundry CLI and note schema under names that leave
  room in the `@galaxy-foundry` scope for other Foundry implementations.

- [#239](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/pull/239) [`ceb66c9`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/foundry/commit/ceb66c905324317f0815cf410cca76f800f762fb) Thanks [@jmchilton](https://github.com/jmchilton)! - Restructure publishable packages: introduce the unified `foundry` CLI bundling all `validate-*` subcommands plus a `summarize-nextflow` wrapper. The summarize-nextflow package now owns its own schema and self-validates without a foundry dependency. The four standalone schema packages (`summary-nextflow-schema`, `summary-cwl-schema`, `galaxy-tool-discovery-schema`, `galaxy-tool-summary-schema`, `tests-format-schema`) are folded into either `summarize-nextflow` (producer-co-located) or `foundry` (orphans).

  their typed APIs, raw JSON exports, validators, and upstream provenance.
